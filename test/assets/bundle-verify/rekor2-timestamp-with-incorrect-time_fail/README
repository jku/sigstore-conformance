This is an invalid hashedrekord 0.0.2 bundle where the entry comes from a Rekor v2 instance. The TSA timestamp in the bundle is otherwise valid but the timestamp time is outside the signing certificate lifetime.

Test creation:
* Start with rekor2-happy-path bundle (which has been created a while ago so
  signing cert lifetime has passed)
* Take the bundle signature, use it as a timestamp payload with timestamp.sigstage.dev
  and replace the timestamp with a new timestamp:

    jq -r .messageSignature.signature < bundle.sigstore.json | base64 -d > payload
    openssl ts -query -data payload -cert -sha256 -out request.tsq
    curl -sSH "Content-Type: application/timestamp-query" \
        --data-binary @request.tsq \
        https://timestamp.sigstage.dev/api/v1/timestamp \
        -o response.tsr
    jq --arg TS "$(base64 response.tsr)" \
        '.verificationMaterial.timestampVerificationData.rfc3161Timestamps[0].signedTimestamp = $TS' < bundle.sigstore.json

The test uses a custom trusted root (it's just the staging trust root: once prod has a rekor v2
instance the test bundle could be replaced and the custom trus root removed)
