This is an invalid bundle where the entry comes from a Rekor v2 instance:
* Entry type is hashedrekord 0.0.2
* there is _no_ TSA timestamp in the bundle: Clients should not verify because 
  rekor 2 entries do not come with a integrated time making TSA timestamps required

The test uses a custom trusted root (it's just the staging trust root: once prod has a rekor v2
instance the test bundle could be replaced and the custom trus root removed)
